Jaedraas,,2013-10,,,,,,60.82,16.5,,Gastrikland:Jadraas,Sweden,SE,185 m,0-0.15 m,eDNA sampling from soil,"Five soil cores were collected from each of twelve 30x30 m plots and separated into visually distinct podzol soil layers before pooling the layers for each plot. From each composite soil sample two sub-samples of approximately 0.5 g wet weight were collected for DNA extraction. Approximately 1500 bp of the rDNA from all soil DNA extracts was amplified using the primer set ITS1F (Gardes & Bruns, 1993) and LR5 (Hopple Jr & Vilgalys, 1994). For each horizon, PCR products were pooled to generate an amplicon library for sequencing on a PacBio RS II system. Resulting sequence reads were trimmed with cutadapt to remove primer sequences and then denoised with dada2 to generate Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs)...",temperate evergreen needleleaf forest (ENVO_01000383)
